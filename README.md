### Build Status
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tilal6991/Relay.svg?branch=develop)

### What is Relay?
Relay is an open source IRC library for Android. It's intended to be easy to use and relatively stable although not yet feature complete or able to be used in production quality code

### Forking
Feel free to fork Relay. At the moment I haven't added the license to the header of the files but it is licensed under the GPLv3. Please do send a pull request if you have made an interesting change and want to have this included. I would appreciate it :)

### List of things that need to be done
* Parsing invites - this need to be done properly - the basic code is present but the handling of the events needs to be set up properly
* Adding licenses to the headers
* Fix up any bugs that are spotted
* Think of more things to add to this list :P
