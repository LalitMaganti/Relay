/**
 * This class is just a thin layer around its parent class, adding an element updating and
 * re-sorting feature which works as follows: <p/> As you might know you should never add or remove
 * elements of Java collections while iterating over them in a loop. There is one exception: If you
 * use an {@link java.util.Iterator Iterator} you may safely use its {@link
 * java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method. Many people do not know that or are even unaware of
 * that method's existence because they iterate using {@code for} loops. <p/> Another problem
 * specifically with sorted collections is that even if they are {@link Comparable Comparable} or
 * use an explicit {@link java.util.Comparator Comparator}, their elements will be sorted at
 * <b>insertion time</b> only and the sort order not updated even if their sorting keys change. If
 * you want to achieve a refresh, you have to <ol> <li> remove them from the collection, <li> update
 * their values and then <li> add them back again. </ol> This class does just that, but in a
 * structured fashion as a bulk operation <b>after</b> your loop has finished or as a single-element
 * operation if you want to do it outside a loop. <p/> Usage example:
 * <pre>
 * import de.scrum_master.util.UpdateableTreeSet;
 * import de.scrum_master.util.UpdateableTreeSet.Updateable;
 *
 * class MyType implements Updateable {
 *     void update(Object newValue) {
 *         // Change the receiver's value
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * SortedSet<MyType> mySortedSet = new UpdateableTreeSet<MyType>();
 *
 * // Add elements to mySortedSet...
 *
 * for (MyType element : mySortedSet) {
 *     if (removeCondition)
 *         markForRemoval(element);
 *     if (updateCondition)
 *         markForUpdate(element, newValue);
 * }
 *
 * mySortedSet.updateMarked();
 * </pre>
 * Special thanks go to user <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/15472/tucuxi">tucuxi at
 * stackoverflow.com</a> because his <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2581450/1082681">answer</a>
 * in one of the discussion threads inspired me to implement this class based on his idea. My
 * version is just a bit more sophisticated because it supports deferred updates and is thus useful
 * within {@code for} loops. <p/>
